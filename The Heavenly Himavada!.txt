We always try to find peace in small things, the monsoon rains, reading our favorite book on a Saturday afternoon and a cup of Chai. 

Living in a city away from home or lost in chaotic world of work, trying to match the expectations of people around you or just trying to get through the day, Just sit back and think of one place you could be at, alone with just yourself - "home", it just need not be where you were born or spent your childhood, its the people, the experiences and the places we long to revisit. 

As mentioned in earlier blogs, we all have a happy place that we cherish. I discovered mine while we took an unplanned diversion on our way to Bandipur Tiger Reserve And National Park.

On a summer morning, the wide roads with cattle's grazing by, led us to The Himavada Gopalaswamy Betta. As we arrived on the hilltop I was instantly in love with the beautiful historically rich temple and the breathtaking view of lush green hills till eyes could reach. These foggy and misty hills topped with drizzles makes your heart happy. If only we could ever experience what heaven felt like, I bet Himavada gives us the closest glimpse of it. 

Gopalaswamy Betta is the highest mountain peak the in Bandipur National park range located in village of Hangala. The temple is dedicated to Lord Venugopala Swamy and was built in Chola regime seven centuries ago, there are 25 tirthas called the chakra tirtha in this region. The area is also frequented by herds of wild elephants and some times by tigers. It is also said that one of elephants visits the temple every morning and pays his respect to lord Krishna and leaves after having a good meal offered by the priest. If you visit the temple early enough you get to listen to the tales and history of himavada. 

Just sitting here for sometime made me feel so refreshed and happy like a kid finally getting her candy after a long day at school. That is when I knew this is my happy place and felt at peace.
