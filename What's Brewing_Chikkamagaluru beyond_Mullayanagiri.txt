Chikkamagaluru a  beautiful city surrounded by the majestic mountains of Western Ghats is in Karnataka state could rightly be called as the "birthplace" to our very own "Coffee" 

Lets just think for a second! 

How would begin your day if coffee was not brought to India? Would there still be coffee shops for our cute little dates?  What we call our office "coffee breaks"

Hahaha! sounds weird right?! We all have to thank a Indian muslim saint Baba Budan :)

Story of the seven beans!

Indian saint Baba Budan learnt about these berries in Yemen and was amazed, so while his journey back home he hid seven coffee beans in his beard and brought the amazing coffee beans for the first time to India. 
In Chandragiri of Chikkamagluru he cultivated them in abundance, the wonderful cool climate of this place was just right for the rich growth of coffee. Hence when the British's came to India, magical beans caught their attention and soon Coffee was everybody's favorite and was propogated to all other colonies and that's how friends coffee is now worlds most loved drink!    I think we should all thank Saint Baba Budan for it. Shouldn't we?

And also, The first largest coffee plantation in Chikkamagalur was Mylemoney, established by Thomas Canon in 1830 which still exists. Wouldn't it be great to visit it atleast once maybe?

So, this is how why I was excited when my friend first mentioned about our trip to Chikkamagluru for my 25th birthday !
