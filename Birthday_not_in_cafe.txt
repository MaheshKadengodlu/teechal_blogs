As we reach this weird age of 25's, our thoughts change, I think we start wishing for a simpler life and wish to be close to nature. 

The busy cities and fancy restaurants seem a little less interesting or may be we could say we are drawn to something we lack here in cities, Peace?

So I was no different, in college Mcd and KFC's excited me but when I moved out to Bangalore after graduation, my preferences started to take a different shape. Maybe it was the people I got connected to and influence of their thoughts? Could be! We all change for better as they say! :)

Fast forward to two years, here I was on my way to this beautiful city of Chikkamagaluru two days prior to my 25th birthday travelling in a local bus awaiting to experience all the stories I had been reading about its coffee estates, foggy mountains and empty unexplored roads!
